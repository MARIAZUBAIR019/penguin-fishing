                  <h3>Concept</h3>                
                
                    <p>
                         

                        The objective of the game is to catch at least 60 fish before loosing all the worms. The player fishes through a hole in the ice. Underneath the hole lay fish but also other potentially dangerous obstacles such as crabs, jellyfish and sharks. The maximum number of fish the player could catch was 64. The playerstarted out with 3 worms for bait and could catch bonus bait throughout the game. Players could catch a Gray Fish if they wore the Flashing Lure Fishing Rod, but they were harder to catch.
