                                Underneath the hole lay fish but also other potentially dangerous obstacles such as crabs,
                                 jellyfish and sharks. The maximum number of fish the player could catch would be depending. 
                                 The player started out with 3 worms for bait and could catch bonus bait throughout the game.
